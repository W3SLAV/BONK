# BONK
BONK is a dynamic programming language for the Nintendo DS that interprets custom .bcf files
(Blin Command Files) into commands (yes, bonk is just a glorified interpreter).
Each .bcf file can be as versitile as you want and can have multiple lines of code for a single command.

## Instructions:

### Adding new Commands
To add a new command create a .bcf file and name it the name of the command (ex: print.bcf = print),
then add the lines of code that the command represents inside the file.

### Using BONK
to use BONK run the python file.

### Programming
All of your custom code should be contained in the main.blin file
